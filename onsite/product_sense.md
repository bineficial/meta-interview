Structure - demonstrates a systematic approach
Comprehensiveness - covers all important aspects
Feasibility - practical enough that it oculd be implemented realistically


Framwework (Diagnose a Problem)
1. Clarify the scenario/metric
2. Time - sudden or stable?
    Internal - data source? data collection? bug?
    External - sesonality? industry trend? competitors? special event? natural disaster?
3. Other product/feature by the same company?
    Have we made any change to our product line?
    Have other related products experienced the same change?
4. Segment by user demographic and behavioral features
    Regions?
    Languages?
    Platforms?
5. Decompose the metric
    Daily Active User = existing + new + resurrected - churned
6. Summarize overall approach
    Most reasonable causes
    How to fix?

Framework (Measure Success)
1. Clarify function and goal of the product/feature
    What it does? How is it used? Who is it for?
2. Define metrics (no more than 3)
    2 success metrics to measure the sucess, eg. daily active users, number of bookings and conversion rate
    1 Guardrail metric, should not degrade in pursuit of a new product/feature, eg. cancelation rate and bounce rate


1. What the company cares about
2. Connection between the product to the goals of the company
3. Top-level ways to measure if this product or featureu is "successful"
4. Sub-metrics
5. Guardrail metrics

1-2 mins Identify what the company cares about
1-2 mins How is the product/feature in question related to the company goals?
3-5 mins Choose top-level metrics that would indicate sucess for the goals you identified
7-10 mins Prioritize sub-metrics that would drive the top-level metrics
    In-product metrics - are things users need to do in order to move the needle in the right direction
    Business metrics - are good indicators of the value that users and the company are getting from your product
    Guardrail metrics - also known as countermetrics, ensure that your product or feature is successfull without harming other parts of business
