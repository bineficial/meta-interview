Question 1

Write a function to return the number of times a character appears in a string. The character can be the empty string.

Question 2

Complete a function that returns a list containing mismatched words in two strings. The return list can be in any order. I used set to solve this question, but was also asked to verbally explain how I would solve it without using sets.

Question 3

Given an array containing None values, fill in the array with the most recent None value. If the list starts with None, then don't do anything to it.

Question 4

Given a dictionary, print the key for nth highest value present in the dict. If there are more than 1 record present for nth highest value then sort the key and print the first one (alphabetically). N can be higher than the number of elements in the dictionary.

Question 5

Given a list of ints, balance the list so that each int appears equally in the list. Return a dictionary where the key is the int and the value is the count needed to balance the list. [1, 1, 2] => {2: 1} [1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2] => {5: 2, 3: 2, 2: 1}

Question 6

What percent of all products in the grocery chain's catalog are both low fat and recyclable?

Question 7

What are the top five (ranked in decreasing order) single-channel media types that correspond to the most money the grocery chain had spent on its promotional campaigns? media_type can contain mutliple values seperated by a comma, so single channel is when media_type only has one value.

Write a query that returns product_family, units_sold, percentage of promoted.
